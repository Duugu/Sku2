TO DO
   Basic stuff to be implemented before addon features
      - build sample modules for bags and questaccept to test approach for securely handeling them

      - keybinds
         - add secure handlers for bind/unbind keys to modules; execute them OnDisable/OnEnable
      - disable/enable modules
         - module dependencies
         - add handler for OnDisable events to modules
      - add dual spec values to char settings and add handlers for them
      - add localized tooltip value to all settings (incl. setting type (char, faction, profile...))
      - add visual menu debug frame
      - test menu performance
      - add tooltips
         - menu & non-menu
      - add menu shortcuts (performance?, secure menus?)
      - again test menu performance (keep shortcuts in mind)
      - manually build the settings parts to final menu structure
         - what should happen with disabled modules settings?
         - should settings value from disabled modules still be saved to WTF?
      - generic UI handlers to be used for setting types w/o custom menus
      - manually build the UI parts to final structure
         - what should happen with disabled UI parts settings?
      - add module to build Current Panels?
         - modules for specifc panels
         - generic for panels w/o module
      - setup the menu with settings and UI final structure
         <xx>
         <...>
         <yy>
         Current Panels
         Settings
      - profile management
      - loading flavor specific DBs
         - parsing string DBs
         - workflow for DB updates, considering existing route data
      - new route data structure (load times, sizes, to many tokens)
        - per map?

   Modules to implement before more general modules
      - sounds repo
      - async voice outputs (audiodata)
         - should be able to easily switch to blizzard tts if they are adding async at some point
      - beacons
